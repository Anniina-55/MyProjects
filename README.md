# Repository Name: MyProjects

## Description:
This repository contains workshop tasks and coding exercises from my learning journey in web development and programming as part of my B.Eng. studies in Information Technology. It serves as the first item in my skill portfolio and demonstrates my basic skills in coding. I will update this repository throughout my studies and add personal projects as well, as my skills grow. 

### Repository branches
- **PersonalProjects**: Currently empty branch; will be updated with personal projects.
- **WorkshopTasks_1year**: JavaScript workshop tasks from the first-year of my studies.
- **Future Branches**: Additional branches will be added as more exercises and projects are completed.

## Technologies & Tools used:

   - **Languages**: JavaScript
   - **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub, Node.js (for running files)

## Folder Overview:

   - **Arrays**: Tasks focused on creating, modifying and looping through arrays.
   - **Loops**: Exercises using different loop structures, such as for, while, and do...while.
   - **Conditionals**: Exercises involving conditional logic, including if...else and switch statements.
   - **FirstWorkshopTasks**: Basic introductory programming tasks.

## Future Plans:
I plan to add more projects, including personal projects, web applications and front-end development projects as I continue learning and building my skills.
